how to collaborate on github
fork the project
create a branch
make changes
commit changes
publish/push the branch(don't merge to main locally)
create pull request
then it may be merged, commented on etc
if it is not merged make changes to code and push again
checkout to main branch to check for updates/merges
pull it to update it
