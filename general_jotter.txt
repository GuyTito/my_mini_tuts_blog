interview question
-------------------
Q. Tell us what excites you about front end development and share an example of how your passion lead to a great user experience

A. I like to enjoy life and it's not supposed to hard at all, therefore I try as much as possible to solve problems that prevent that. Frontend dev is instant and you learn quickly about how the product is or will be used to solve a problem. This makes me want to really build good user experience which makes the product easy, fun and enjoyable to use.

Some time ago, I used to play football(soccer) with my friends on weekends. After every game, we record the goal scorers on a WhatsApp platform we are all part of. 
I realized that this will not be convenient for long as the person would have to copy and paste the whole data every time to update it. 
So I came up with solution to build a web app to make it easy to record and access the data. This greatly improved user experience.

generics is for creating reusable code for types. if you wanna use the structure of the function for different types. the type checking is enforced when the function is implemented(like object created from a class) with a type. a placeholder for the type to be implemented.


I am interested in your training program because it is a cutting edge program. It is not easy to find out such training program for data analytics. I have a keen interest in technology and mathematics, and have been fascinated by solving business problems and finding solutions for them. I am also very interested in how data analytics can be applied to business to find solutions. I want to make a difference in my community and in the world. I would like to be able to do that by helping to find out how to solve challenging problems and make the world a better place. 




typescript declaration files are files that contain type information for existing javascript code. they dont compile to javascript code.



if youre testing a function with a callback as argument, you have to pass a function as a parameter to the "it" or "test" function which need to be called inside the callback function. wrap a try-catch block around the expected statement together with the callback.


The most entrepreneurial thing I have ever done was to join a network marketing company. I always knew I wanted to have my own business but I was drawn to network marketing because of the low cost of entry. I didn't have to invest a lot of money to get started and I could work from home on my own schedule. I also found it easy to talk to people and really enjoyed helping others. It was a lot of work, but it was also very rewarding. I learned a lot about myself and what I was capable of. I also had to learn how to manage my time and resources effectively. Overall, it was a great experience and I am glad I did it.


I would like to take this role because I want to work with the ever changing technologies in the web development industry. Also, fintech industry is booming and there are a lot of opportunities to grow and develop. 
Furthermore, frontend development is fun and challenging. I get a kick out of building something that people can interact with. I like being able to see the fruits of my labor in action. Being a frontend developer is like being a magician who is able to make magic happen just by writing few lines of code. I want to be that person who puts a smile on users' face by creating awesome user experience.
Finally, I get to use innovative technologies to create financial products and services that will be used by college students, seniors, large businesses, and banks around the world.




when you use a function as a callback, you lose the 'this' object if the function is using 'this' within it.


fetch automatically rejects a network error eg. when network is off. the ok property on the response object helps us catch http errors.


if the dependency array is empty, the code inside useEffect runs once at the beginning. But if there is an element in the array, any change of an element in the array will result in a rerun of the code inside it. but if there is no array, the code inside the useEffect runs after every render. React components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props.


any subscription to a websocket will require an unsubscription when it unmounts in a component. The cleanup function in useEffect hook is used for the unsubscription in react. this is done to avoid memory leak. you return the cleanup function.

Boy, if not for styled components I would not know there is something like tagged template. Omo! Man, you may not know everything in the documentation, but if you keep building projects and reading other people's code, you'll keep discovering new shit.
When I saw this, I was like what the hell is this. I've not seen this syntax before. Is it typescript, react, etc. wtf!


Driving tip: If you want to straighten the steering wheel, turn the wheel fully to any direction whether left/right till it locks, then turn the wheel one rotation and a half in the other direction.

Since when i got to understand that consistency is the key to mastery, i've been commited to learning various skills almost every day; socializing, programming, weightlifting, driving, handstanding, etc.
I just have acquired the mindset that, no matter the time it'll take, if I do it consistently, one day i'll be good at it.



So yesterday, I was telling my younger sister about McDonald's chicken nuggets because she sells shawarma. She told me she had watched this movie called, The Founder, but didn't understand so she asked, "How is McDonald's a real estate company?" In my mind I shouted, "Finally!" You have no idea how long I've been waiting for this question since I watched that movie. I gladly explained to her. Then she exclaimed in surprise and relief, "Aaaaaah!!" Same reaction when I finally understood it. Is that not wonderful? 😁
By the way, the interaction was in Twi.😁😁

/   = Root directory

./  = Current directory
../ = Parent of current directory
../../ = Two directories backwards



so the sort function on default (without compare fn) sort by converting values to string and comparing based on utf-stuff. when you supply a fn(with two args), it should return a >0(positive value), <0(negative value) or 0. postive means the 1st arg is sorted after the 2nd arg. if negative, vice versa. if 0, it keeps the original order.




"this" in the context of an object. if you wana access "employees" which is inside a "data" object, you write "data.employees". this is how you access it outside of the object. whatif you want to access it inside the object? one of the properties(say "setEmployee") want to access the "employees" property. you cant write "data.employees" inside "setEmployee". what do you do? you write "this.employees". that is how you use "this" to access employees. because "this" is "data", but cant write "data" within the "data" object. you write "data" when you wanna access it outside of it.
so you use "this" for inward calling. and oh! "this" is undefined in an arrow function!


3 values

next time you use the navlink from react router, if the active class/style will be added in the css, then there is no need to write a function for the className prop to add the active class. if you'll add the active class in the jsx, it is recommended to abstract the navlink component into a custom component to avoid repeating the function for all links that may be active.



when using react-icons, the first two/three letters of an icon name is the clue to where to import it from. eg: for 'faUser' icon, you'll write "import {fafUser} from 'react-icons/fa'" (without the double quotes).



so i use Event.stopPropagation() to stop propagating the action of a click event from a parent to the child. so that if i click on the parent modal (which is the background overlay) to close the modal, the action does not propagate to the child elements (like modal content, etc). in that case, clicking on the child elements will not close the modal. i only want the close modal to happen when i click on the background overlay. so this "onClick={e => e.stopPropagation()}" is placed on the immediate child element.

the great thing about axios is that, it will throw an error if there is one, unlike fetch where you'll have to check for errors explicitly with response.ok. Also, no need to convert the data on response to json with json().


setstate (in usestate hook) parameters are the state or an an anonymous function with the state as its parameter. the state is current.


if (!err?.response) {} // this statement means that if there is no response on the err object. or if there is no err object with response. 


remember to keep striving for progress over perfection. a little progress everyday will go a very long way.

A "selector function" is any function that accepts the Redux store state (or part of the state) as an argument, and returns data that is based on that state. (https://redux.js.org/usage/deriving-data-selectors)
selectors are pure functions that get data from the redux store and return them so that they can be used by react components. with the help of selectors, any change in the shape of the state of the redux store does not affect the react component that consumes it.
One common description of selectors is that they're like "queries into your state".


Selectors used with useSelector or mapState will be re-run after every dispatched action. we need memoised functions to prevent wastage of cpu time.


 A memoized function has a memory: it keeps track of the previous arguments that were passed into it and keeps track of the previous result. Memoization helps avoid unnecessary re-renders.
 A memoized function will “remember” the last set of arguments it received, and the value it returned. Then, the next time it’s called, it’ll check – are these new arguments the same as last time? If they are, return the old value (without recomputing it). Otherwise, recompute, and remember the new set of arguments + return value. Memoization (not memorization… even though the concept is the same) is basically a fancy word for caching.


 The Reselect library provides a number of useful features for creating selectors that find and extract data inside the state tree in more sophisticated ways. To do this, we need to use Reselect’s createSelector function. selectors built with Reselect are memoized. 

Don't feel like you need to write selectors for every single field of your state. Try starting without any selectors, and add some later when you find yourself looking up the same values in many parts of your application code.


normalised state
Normalized state shape usually looks like {ids: [], entities: {}}
{
 entities: {
  authors : { byId : {}, allIds : [] },
  books : { byId : {}, allIds : [] },
  authorBook : {
   byId : {
    1 : {
     id : 1,
     authorId : 5,
     bookId : 22
    },
    2 : {
     id : 2,
     authorId : 5,
     bookId : 15,
    },
    3 : {
     id : 3,
     authorId : 42,
     bookId : 12
    }
   },
   allIds : [1, 2, 3]

  }
 }
}

the code manipulating the dom(side effect) using the useRef node should be inside the useEffect hook. Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components are all examples of side effects.


- find the companies you want to work at
- ask people for advice on how they got a job you are also trying to get. message them on linkedin etc. this is networking to get a job and flipping the job search. the aim is to build a connection so that you may be referred\recommended for a job.
- every cv you send should be diff by sharing the same keywords with its job description you're applying to.
- when sending cv attach it with a thoughtful email that shares the value you have to offer to the hiring company.
- before interview, research company and its products and see how you can contribute to the growth of the company. how can a (frontend) developer help a company grow. not only forntend tho but being an overall team player to the whole company and solving problems not only for the role but for the business as a whole. how to find out if a company is profiting or losing. present your results during the interview. proactive interview. they should see you as the one helping them by presenting your solutions to their problems.
-“Hey, I saw that you have this role. Here is something similar that I’ve done in the past.
However, I’m looking for something more challenging. My experience with doing this thing
shows that I can do that thing that you want, so check out this.” This is often called a portfolio. 
- Even when you’re making a regular application when you put this cover letter, yours should be “here are
the things that I’ve worked on, here are the things that I’ve learned in those things, here’s how I
would apply those to this opportunity that you have right now.”
- you need to be more proactive about
how you go about your job search. Proactive across all stages of your job search. Proactive in the sense that you need to decide what kind of company you want to work with, research what kind of roles, and target people who can help you get into the door. That’s being proactive.
- Being reactive is just going online, seeing a role on Jobberman and sending your CV,
and just waiting for them to call you back. And then, I’m not sure how many people get
an email back except all those “we’re sorry, the role has been filled. We found a better
candidate” That happens a lot.
- Be proactive with job search, with the interview, be proactive in understanding, just
thinking about the hiring manager, “why did they open this role? What is the problem?
Research everything. Find every possible problem that they may have that keeps them
awake at night, think up solutions, and hope that they’ll give you an opportunity to
start selling yourself. If they don’t, find an opportunity in between the questions you
are asked
- You should take charge of the interview from the moment you sit in the interview.
Once you’ve gotten to the point where you’ve gotten all the pleasantries out of the
way, you should say, “I’ve been thinking a lot about this role, and these are my
proposals as to how you can better solve the problem. I guarantee you, five out of ten
times, you’ll get a callback, and if you don’t get the job, it’s because of something else.
I’ve never interviewed a person who did that and said, “that person is unserious; I’ll
consider other candidates.”

a side effect is a functionality that is not returned by the function but it affects something outside the function. eg. dom manipulation, console.log, etc... not used in a pure function.


An action, is an object that contains the payload of information and description of the action to take (action type). They are the only source of information for the Redux store to be updated. Reducers does the real update on the store based on the payload of the action. [check bookmark]


extraReducers is  built to handle other actions (actions outside the slice reducer like the ones generated in other slices or actions made by createAction or createAsyncThunk).  [check bookmark]



if you'll have to compute values with input from the redux state and serve the results to the components, its better to put them into createSelector to cache values and prevent  recomputing same inputs.
